# Part 3: Troubleshooting - Account Lockout and Remote Assistance

This section focuses on two essential administrative tasks in a domain environment:

1. Unlocking and resetting a locked-out user account

2. Enabling and initiating Remote Desktop connections for remote support


These steps simulate a common scenario in which an end user forgets their password, causing account lockout, and the IT Helpdesk resolves the issue remotely.

## Step 1: Simulate Account Lockout

The user Bruce Wayne attempts multiple incorrect logins, causing the account to become locked due to the domain password policy.

## Step 2: Unlock and Reset Password via Active Directory

1. Open Active Directory Users and Computers on the Helpdesk machine

2. Locate the user Bruce Wayne

3. Right-click > Properties > Account tab

4. Check the box to Unlock account

## Step 3: User Creates New Password at Next Login

After the password reset, Bruce Wayne logs into the domain and is prompted to create a new password.

## To Conclude

In this final part of the lab project, we successfully:

- Simulated a common user issue (account lockout)

- Used Active Directory tools to unlock the account and enforce a password reset

- Enabled Remote Desktop on the client machine for remote support

- Connected from the Helpdesk machine to the client using Remote Desktop

This exercise reinforces essential troubleshooting workflows and remote management techniques that IT administrators use daily in a Windows Server environment.
